# Welcome!
This is a collection of the protocols I have done during our Physics practicum classes (i.e. the classes in which we perform some classical Physics experiments). Unfortunately, the larger amount of it is done in Bulgarian. Nevertheless, you can check it out and see some of the cool experiments we recreate on our own, or you can find it useful with some nice equations :smiley:

All the images in the protocols (except the ones which have a cited source associated with them under the picture) are done by me via [draw.io](draw.io/) :face_in_clouds: In each protocol's directory there's a `\raw` directory where one can find an Excel sheet with the raw data. It is pretty unorganized, nevertheless you are welcome to explore and decode it! 

I cannot really imagine that repo developing in any way, but yet if you have any suggestions, contributions are welcomed! Enjoy! :blush:
