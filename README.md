# Welcome!
This is a collection of the protocols I have done in our Physics practicums. Unfortunately, the larger amount of it is done in Bulgarian. Nevertheless, you can check it out and see some of the cool experiments we do in class, or you can find it useful with some nice equations :smiley:

All the images in the protocols (except the ones which have a cited source associated with them under the picture) are done by me via [draw.io](draw.io/) :face_in_clouds: Enjoy!
